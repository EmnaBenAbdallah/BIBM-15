In this section, we show the effectiveness of our approach on some examples,
and compare it to other existing approaches.
All computations (except the one called \textsc{ASP-Thomas}) were performed on a Pentium~V, 3.2~GHz with 4~GB RAM.

\subsection{Evaluation}
To assess the efficiency of our new approach,
we position ourselves with respect to existing methods dealing with different biological models.
We have chosen the following tools, that are detailed below: 
\textsc{GINsim}\footnote{\textsc{GINsim} version 2.4 alpha: \url{http://ginsim.org/}} (Gene Interaction Network Simulation)~\cite{gonzalez2006ginsim,naldi2009logical,naldi2007decision};
\textsc{LibDDD}\footnote{\textsc{LibDDD} version 1.8: \url{http://move.lip6.fr/software/DDD/}}
(Library of Data Decision Diagrams)~\cite{thierry2009hierarchical,colange2013towards};
\textsc{Pint}\footnote{\textsc{Pint} version 2015-11-14: \url{http://loicpauleve.name/pint/}}~\cite{PMR12-MSCS};
and a method for CTL model-checking proposed by Rocca \textit{et al.} in~\cite{roccaasp}
which was also developed in ASP.
%but for states transitions networks.
Each method uses a specific kind of representation\footnote{When available, we used the converters included into \textsc{Pint} for these translations.}:
Thomas models (a particular kind of logical regulatory networks) for \textsc{GINsim}
and the method of Rocca \textit{et al.},
instantiable transition systems for \textsc{LibDDD},
%state transition networks for the method of Rocca \textit{et al.}
and Process Hitting (PH) for \textsc{Pint} as well as for our method.

For this comparative study, we focus on biological network of different sizes:
a tadpole tail resorption (TTR) model with 12 biological components~\cite{khalis2009smbionet},
an ERBB receptor-regulated G1/S transition (ERBB) model with 20 components~\cite{Samaga2009}
and a T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling network of 40 components~\cite{Klamt06}.
These models were chosen to be of different sizes:
from small (12 components) to large (40 components).
We note however that the considered PH models may contain more sorts than
the original number of biological components, due to the use of
"cooperative sorts'', which allow to model Boolean gates but do not necessarily
have a biological meaning.
The different model representations that are required to perform these benchmarks have been obtained by translations
from the PH
ensuring the conservation of the dynamical properties.

The specification of the models and the results of our enumeration of the fixed points
are summed up in \pref{tab:models}.
The time performance is roughly the same than the SAT implementation
that comes with \textsc{Pint}.
The results for several methods regarding reachability properties
are summarized in \pref{tab:reachability}.
The methods and the results provided by each of them are detailed in the following.
The overall results show that our method is efficient in computing reachability
from a given initial state;
furthermore, it sometimes provides more information than the other existing ones.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

\item \textbf{\textsc{GINsim}} is a software for the edition, simulation and analysis
of gene interaction networks.
It allows to compute all reachable fixed points from a given initial state instantly;
however, it is not possible to compute all fixed points independently from the initial state.
Regarding the reachability problem, \textsc{GINsim} only allows to check the reachability of
full states, because its approach consists in computing
(part of) the state-transition graph and then searching for a path between the two given states.
Therefore, it was not possible to perform reachability checks on partial states
(experiments \#3 \& \#5).
Small state-transition graphs can also be displayed by this tool.

\item \textbf{\textsc{LibDDD}}
is a library for symbolic model-checking of CTL \& LTL properties.
It can thus especially be used to check reachability properties;
however, as opposed to our method, it does not output an execution path
solving this reachability.
In addition, it relies on the construction of the state-transition graph
which is then stored under the form of a binary decision diagram for a more efficient analysis.
This computation explains why \textsc{LibDDD} takes more time to respond,
and gets out of memory in about 12 minutes for the biggest example
which contains $2^{73}$ states
(experiments \#4 \& \#5).
Finally, \textsc{LibDDD} is not able to compute the fixed points of a network.

\item \textbf{\textsc{Pint}}
is a library gathering tools and converters related to the PH.
It should be noted that \textsc{Pint} contains the only reachability analysis
developed so far natively for the Process Hitting,
before the method proposed in this paper.
It consists in an approximation that avoids to compute the state-transition graph;
it is thus ensured to be really efficient, which explains the fastest results,
but at the cost of possibly terminating without being conclusive.
However, it is not designed for goals consisting of many processes,
which are more likely to trigger an inconclusive response
(such as for experiment \#4),
or an exponential research in sub-solutions
(such as for experiment \#2).
This explains the high computation times for some of the tests.
Moreover, in the case of a positive answer,
it currently does not return the execution of the path achieving the desired reachability,
but only outputs its conclusion (True, False or Inconclusive).

\item \textbf{\textsc{ASP-Thomas}}\footnote{The authors wish to thank Laurent Trilling for his help to perform the tests.}
offers the possibility to model-check CTL properties of Thomas networks. 
There is however no automatic way that allows the modeling of Thomas networks in ASP, which currently has to be made by hand and requires labeling. As for our method, we use the PH whose actions are easily represented in ASP with one fact per action.
In addition, the method \textsc{ASP-Thomas} requires to provide a maximum number of steps
for which the dynamics will be computed, which may be difficult to be predicted. Furthermore, all dynamics of the system have to be computed up to $n$ steps in order to perform a depth first verification.
It is not the case for our method which can stop as soon as the goal is met, and thus potentially before the $n$\textsuperscript{th} step.
%, the program will stop at the first step that reach the goals: breath first search.
However it is clear that with a minimal number of steps this approach terminates very quickly when compared with others.
It also shows that ASP is a good choice to run the dynamics of a model and check reachability properties.
The a summary of differences between our approach and \textsc{ASP-Thomas} is detailed in \pref{tab:qualitative_differences}.
The main difference is that, in \textsc{ASP-Thomas}, the search is bounded.
If the number of steps to reach the goal is part of the goal or if one can a priori know the length of the path to reach the specified goal,
this approach can provide very good performance.
But if the bound is totally unknown, choosing a too small path length can naturally lead to miss the goal.
%and thus to conclude it is unreachable when it is reachable.
On the other hand, choosing a bound that is too big will greatly impact the performance.
For example, in experiment \#3, the goal is reachable with a path of 18 steps,
and using a bound of 21, \textsc{ASP-Thomas} finishes in 2.61s.
However, if we fix the bound to 30 steps, it takes several minutes.
We can observe similar results on the others benchmarks.
With our approach, if the goal is reachable, the run time only depends on the distance to reach the goal.
In \textsc{ASP-Thomas}, the run time only depends of the chosen bound, because all paths of the chosen length will be generated before being checked.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

In the previous sections,
we developed two new methods in ASP to check dynamical properties,
namely identifying fixed points and finding all the shortest paths to reach a given goal.
Compared to some other methods described above
(\textsc{GINsim} and \textsc{LibDDD}) our method is relatively faster and also permits to study larger networks
(up to $2^{73}$ states in our tests). We exclusively studied networks modeled in Process Hitting. This new formalism for network modeling is a restriction of synchronous automata and thus allows to represent any kind of dynamical model. Moreover, the dynamics of PH it is easy to implement into ASP.

In practice, we can detect the loops in the model dynamics and avoid to check the same path again.
However, the iterative version of \textsc{Clingo} will continue to iterate even no availbale response is satisfied by the itirative part of the program. We faced this problem in the solver of \textsc{Clingo}, indeed the it should return an \texttt{unsatisfiable} response instead of iterating in vacuum.
To our knowledge, there is no possibility yet to force the incrementation to stop in this iterative \textsc{Clingo} version without reaching the goals.
It is still possible, however, to limit the number of iterations to an arbitrary
maximum which will be eventually reached in such case.
This is possible with the use of a construct limiting the maximum number of steps: "\texttt{\#const imax = n.}'',
where \texttt{n} is the maximum number of steps.

Several values can be given to this parameter \texttt{n}.
For example, the total number of states is an obvious maximum,
as it will never be exceeded by a minimum path,
but it is too hight to be very interesting.
The total number of sorts is a more interesting value,
under the hypothesis that each one will change its active process at most once,
which is often the case for Boolean networks;
or, with a similar reasoning, the total number of processes can be chosen.

Given our implementation, if the step \texttt{n} is reached (meaning no valid path was found),
the computation stops with an \texttt{unsatisfiable} response for the reachability.
But, if the goal is reached at some intermediary step, it is not necessary to continue the iteration up to ``\texttt{n}''.
Instead, the computation is stopped and the current trace of the reachability is returned.
In comparison, \textsc{ASP-Thomas} has to compute all possible dynamic evolutions of length ``\texttt{n}'' before verifying the property.
