\pref{def:PH} introduces the Process Hitting~(PH)~\cite{PMR10-TCSB}
which allows to model a finite number of local levels,
called \emph{processes},
grouped into a finite set of components, called \emph{sorts}.
A process is noted $a_i$, where $a$ is the sort's name,
and $i$ is the process identifier within sort $a$.
At any time, exactly one process of each sort is \emph{active},
and the set of active processes is called a \emph{state}.

The concurrent interactions between processes are defined by a set of \emph{actions}.
Each action is responsible for the replacement of one process by another of the same sort
conditioned by the presence of at most one other process in the current state.
An action is denoted by $\PHfrappe{a_i}{b_j}{b_k}$, which is read as
``$a_i$ \emph{hits} $b_j$ to make it \emph{bounce} to $b_k$'',
where $a_i$, $b_j$, $b_k$ are processes of sorts $a$ and $b$,
called respectively \emph{hitter}, \emph{target} and
\emph{bounce} of the action.
We also call a \emph{self-hit} any action whose hitter and target sorts are the same,
that is, of the form: $\PHfrappe{a_i}{a_i}{a_k}$.

The PH is therefore a restriction of synchronous automata, where each transition
changes the local state of exactly one automaton,
and is triggered by the local states of at most two distinct automata.
This restriction in the form of the actions was chosen to permit
the development of efficient static analysis methods
based on abstract interpretation~\cite{PMR12-MSCS}
We also use this particular form the dynamical analyses that we present in this paper.
However, despite to this restriction, we can add non-biological components into the system, that we call \emph{cooperative sorts} and that allow to model the cooperation between 2 or more components. This allows to partly palliate the reduced expressivity of the PH framework.
%So it maintains the effectiveness of the static and dynamic analysis.

\begin{definition}[Process Hitting]\label{def:PH}
  A \emph{Process Hitting} is a triple $(\PHs,\PHl,\PHa)$ where:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  $\PHs = \{a,b,\dots\}$ is the finite set of \emph{sorts};
    \item  $\PHl = \prod_{a\in\PHs} \PHl_a$ is the set of \emph{states} where
      $\PHl_a = \{a_0,\dots,a_{l_a}\}$
      is the finite set of \emph{processes} of sort $a\in\Sigma$
      and $l_a$ is a positive integer, with $a\neq b\Rightarrow \PHl_a \cap \PHl_b = \emptyset$;
    \item  $\PHa = \{ \PHfrappe{a_i}{b_j}{b_k} \in \PHl_a \times \PHl_b^2 \mid
      (a,b) \in \PHs^2 \wedge b_j\neq b_k \wedge a=b\Rightarrow a_i=b_j\}$
      is the finite set of \emph{actions}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Boxes represent the sorts (biological components and multiplexes), circles represent the processes (component levels), and the actions that model the dynamic behavior are depicted by pairs of arrows in solid and dotted lines. $a$, $b$ and $z$ are all either at level $0$ or $1$, and the cooperative sort $ab$ has 4 levels corresponding to the combination of the levels of sorts $a$ and $b$.

\end{example}

A state of the network is a set of active processes containing a single process of each sort.
The active process of a given sort $a \in \PHs$ in a state $s \in \PHl$
is noted $\PHget{s}{a}$.
For any given process $a_i$ we also note: $a_i \in s$ if and only if $\PHget{s}{a} = a_i$. It means that the biological component $a$ is in the condition labeled $i$ within state $s$.

\begin{definition} [Playable action]
\label{def:playableAction}
Let $\PH = (\PHs,\PHl,\PHa)$ be a Process Hitting and $s \in \PHl$ a state of $\PH$.
We say that the action $h = \PHfrappe{a_i}{b_j}{b_k} \in \PHa$
is \emph{playable in state $s$} if and only if
$a_i \in s$ and $b_j \in s$ (\ie $\PHget{s}{a} = a_i$ and $\PHget{s}{b}=b_j$).
The resulting state after playing $h$ in $s$
is called a \emph{successor} of $s$ and
is denoted by $(s \play h)$,
where $\PHget{(s \play h)}{b} = b_k$ and
$\forall c \in \PHs, c \neq b \Rightarrow \PHget{(s \play h)}{c}=\PHget{s}{c}$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Dynamical properties}

The study of the dynamics of biological networks was the focus of many works, explaining the diversity of network modelings and the different methods developed in order to check dynamic properties.
In this paper we focus on two main properties of a PH model: the stable states and the reachability.
In the following, we consider a PH model $\PH=(\PHs,\PHl,\PHa)$,
and we formally define these properties.
How to verify them on a networks with ASP is the subject of the rest of this paper.
%and explain how they could be verified on such a network.

A \emph{fixed point}, also called \emph{stable state},
is a state which has no successor,
as given in \pref{def:fixpoint}.
Such states have a particular interest as they denote states in which the model
stays indefinitely,
and the existence of several of these states denotes a switch in the dynamics~\cite{wuensche1998genomic}.

\begin{definition}[Fixed point]
\label{def:fixpoint}
  A state $s \in \PHl$ is called a \emph{fixed point}
  (or equivalently \emph{stable state})
  if and only if it has no successors.
  In other words, $s$ is a fixed point if and only if no action is playable in this state:
  \[\forall \PHfrappe{a_i}{b_j}{b_k} \in \PHa, a_i \notin s \vee b_j \notin s \enspace.\]
\end{definition}

A finer and more interesting dynamical property consists in
the notion of \emph{reachability}.
Such a property, formally expressed in \pref{def:reachability},
states that starting from a given initial state, it is possible
to reach a given goal, that is, a state that contains a process
or a set of processes.
Checking such a dynamical property is considered difficult
as, in usual model-checking techniques,
it is required to build (a part of) the state graph,
which has an exponential complexity.

In the following, if $s \in \PHl$ is a state,
we call \emph{scenario in~$s$}
any sequence of actions that are successively playable in $s$.
We also note $\Sce(s)$ the set of all scenarios in $s$.
Moreover, we denote by $\Proc = \bigcup_{a \in \PHs} \PHl_a$
the set of all process in $\PH$.

\begin{definition}[Reachability property]
\label{def:reachability}
  If $s \in \PHl$ is a state and $A \subseteq \Proc$ is a set of processes,
  we denote by $\mathcal{P}(s, A)$ the following \emph{reachability property}:
  \[\mathcal{P}(s, A) \equiv \exists \delta \in \Sce(s), \forall a_i \in A, \PHget{(s \play \delta)}{a} = a_i
    \enspace.\]
\end{definition}

The aim of this paper is to focus on the resolution of issues related to the previous definitions:
we give algorithms enumerating all fixed points (\pref{sec:fixpoint})
and verifying a reachability property (\pref{sec:dynamics}).
This last approach also requires tackle the simulation of a PH model, that is, the enumeration of all reachable states.
%Finally we compare our results to other existing methods and we give their respective strengths and limits.
